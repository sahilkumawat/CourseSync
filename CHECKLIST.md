# CourseSync

CourseSync is a Next.js application that allows Berkeley students to upload a screenshot of their weekly class schedule and automatically sync it to Google Calendar as recurring events. The production site is available at `https://coursesyncer.com`.

## Features

- 🔐 Google OAuth authentication with Calendar permissions
- 📸 Upload schedule screenshots (from CalCentral/Schedule Planner)
- 🔍 OCR-powered text extraction using Google Cloud Vision
- 🧭 Pixel-based grid tick detection (Sharp) for stable time boundaries
- 📅 Automatic parsing of class schedules (course name, room, day, time, instructor)
- ✏️ Review and edit parsed class information
- 🎨 Color picker for each class (matches Google Calendar colors)
- 📆 Sync to Google Calendar as recurring weekly events with colors
- ⏱️ Supports class durations from 60-180+ minutes (in 30-minute increments)
- 🎯 Works with classes from any department (not limited to specific keywords)

## Tech Stack

- **Frontend**: Next.js 15 (App Router), TypeScript, React, TailwindCSS
- **OCR**: Google Cloud Vision API
- **Authentication**: NextAuth.js with Google OAuth
- **Calendar**: Google Calendar API
- **Date Handling**: date-fns v3, date-fns-tz v3

## Usage

1. **Sign in**: Click "Sign in with Google" and authorize Calendar permissions
2. **Upload**: Upload a screenshot of your weekly schedule from CalCentral
3. **Review**: Edit class details (title, location, day, time, color) as needed
4. **Configure**: Set semester start/end dates and time zone
5. **Sync**: Click "Sync to Google Calendar" to create recurring events with colors
6. **View**: Click "Open Google Calendar" to view your synced classes

## How It Works

### OCR & Parsing Pipeline

1. **OCR Extraction**: Uses Google Cloud Vision to extract text with bounding boxes
2. **Tick Detection**: Uses Sharp to detect the 15-minute gridline ticks directly from pixels
3. **Day Header Detection**: Identifies day headers (Monday-Friday) and builds X-coordinate to day mapping
4. **Border Detection**: Detects the colored left border of class blocks to get true block bounds
5. **Class Block Creation**:
   - Parses text lines to extract title, location, instructors (handles any department)
   - Converts block bounds to tick indices, then maps ticks to time using the first hour label as an anchor
   - Rounds to :00/:30 and clamps back-to-back overlaps
6. **Color Assignment**: Automatically assigns unique colors to each class based on title (same course = same color)

### Calendar Sync

1. **First Occurrence**: Calculates the first occurrence of each class's day-of-week within the semester
2. **Recurrence Rule**: Creates weekly recurring events using RFC5545 RRULE format
3. **Calendar Creation**: Optionally creates a new calendar or uses primary calendar
4. **Event Creation**: Creates events with assigned colors, location (if available), and instructor information
5. **Post-Sync**: Provides direct link to Google Calendar to view synced events

## Key Features & Improvements

- **Robust Parsing**: Works with classes from any department (Music, History, etc.) - not limited to specific keywords
- **Flexible Durations**: Supports class durations from 60-180+ minutes (rounded to 30-minute increments)
- **Color Coding**: Each class gets a unique color automatically, editable via Google Calendar-style color picker
- **Smart Time Calculation**: Uses slot height offset for accurate time mapping, handles edge cases (classes with only titles, etc.)
- **User-Friendly Review**: Edit all class details before syncing, with direct link to Google Calendar after sync

## Limitations (MVP)

- Only supports Berkeley's standard weekly schedule layout (Monday-Friday grid)
- Requires English labels ("Monday", "10am", etc.)
- User must manually provide semester start/end dates
- No automatic detection of schedule format variations
- Times are rounded to nearest half-hour (:00 or :30)

## Access Control

- **Email Allowlist**: Optionally restrict access to specific email addresses
- Configure `ALLOWED_EMAILS` in `.env.local` as a comma-separated list (e.g., `user1@berkeley.edu,user2@berkeley.edu`)
- If `ALLOWED_EMAILS` is not set, all authenticated users are allowed (for development)
- Unauthorized users see an access restricted message and cannot use the service

## Error Handling

- If OCR fails: User sees error message suggesting higher-resolution screenshot
- If parsing fails: User sees error message about schedule format
- If Calendar API errors: Generic error message with details in console (dev mode)
- If email not in allowlist: User is redirected to unauthorized page
